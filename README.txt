The anatomical phantom is derived from T1, T2, PD-weighted images formed from the average of 27, 12 and 12 scans respectively, of the same normal subject. 
These volumes are defined at a 0.5mm isotropic voxel grid in Talairach space, with dimensions 362*434*362 (XxYxZ) and start coordinates -90,-126,-72 (x,y,z).

A discret phantom was created by storing the label of the most important fraction class at each voxel location.

Definitions of the tissue labels:

0: Background
1: Cerebro-spinal fluid
2: Gray Matter
3: White Matter
4: Fat
5: Muscles     
6: Skin and Muscles
7: Skull
9: Fat 2
10: Dura 
11: Marrow
12: Vessels
